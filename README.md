# This project demonstrates a beginner-friendly setup of MCP (Model Context Protocol) using multiple MCP servers and a single client agent

It shows how an LLM can:

- Discover tools from different MCP servers

- Decide which tool to call

- Invoke them automatically using MCP

- Return structured results
